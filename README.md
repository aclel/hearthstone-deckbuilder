# Hearthstone Deck Builder

A Hearthstone Deck Builder written in Elm. It consumes omgvamp's unofficial [Hearthstone API](https://market.mashape.com/omgvamp/hearthstone).

## Getting Started

1. Install [elm](http://elm-lang.org/install)
2. Run `elm-reactor` in the directory
3. Go to http://locahost:8000/Main.elm

Note: Only a small set of cards are being loaded at the moment as the API does not support pagination.
